To do:
* have a couple of tests to confirm that the CLI configures the options appropriately
* include a separate system test

Done:
* don't test functionality through CLI
* override class to allow instant scheduling
* use httpx_mock fixture from pytest-httpx
        httpx_mock.add_response("http://example.com", method="GET")
* Maybe we need to use @pytest.mark.asyncio
* online/offline tests should have featureless configuration (retries=0, method=GET, regex=None, no kafka, no identifier, timeout=0.1)
* feature tests should then switch these on and off
* features:
  - custom HTTP method
  - regex
  - retries
  - timeout
  - frequency-online
  - frequency-offline
  - identifier


Things to test:
* examples in documentation
